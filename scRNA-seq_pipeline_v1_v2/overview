processing_GEx: 
To process 10x data (cellRanger) and perform initial filtering and QC of scRNA-seq data on the transcriptome captured. 

processing_shuffleBC:
To process single-cell captured T7 IVT shuffleBC data and obtain table of UMI counts by barcode and cell.

iterative_clonotype_mapping: 
To de novo identify clonotypes from correlated detections of shuffleBCs. 

cell_to_clonotype_assignment: 
To perform the  assignment of cells to clonotypes (also used in the iterative clonotype identification). 

QC_barnyard_precision_recall: 
To assess fraction of spurious shuffleBC detections from the barnyard experiment, and from high quality clonotypes. 

v1_scripts:
Similar scripts used to analyze data from the first version of the manuscript.
